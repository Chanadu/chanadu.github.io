				<h2>Professional About your character: </h2>
				<p>
					Griz is a young but competent man of the sea who would like a job as a sailor. He had been on the
					sea and knows how to do many things on a ship that would make him very qualified. He has spent most
					of his life sailing the sea by himself, showing his ability to act independently. Therefore, Griz is
					one of the most qualified and competent people that you could hire to be a sailor.
