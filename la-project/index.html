				<h2>About Griz (the main character):</h2>
				<p>
					Griz is the main character of the book <i>A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World</i>.
					At the start of the book, Griz explained the current world situation of only having a couple
					thousand people spread out throught the entire world.
					Throught the book, Griz chased revenge against someone who had lied to him before by stealing his
					dog.
					Griz battled with the idea of trusting others due to the fear of others lying to them.

				<h2>Author Message: </h2>
				<p>
					The author's, Charlie Fletcher's, main idea and theme of the book is to display how one is affected
					by revenge. Throught the entire book, Charlie Fletcher constantly showed the tarnishment of one's
					morality as they pursue their personal revenge on others. For example, near the end of the novel,
					Griz was captured by the Cons while trying to catch Brand. After lying to the Cons, Griz had said
					"That made the lie easier to tell."(Fletcher 335) At the start of the novel, Griz had the idea that
					lying was horrible instilled into him by everyone around him. However, when Griz was caught by the
					Cons because of his quest for revenge, he lied to them, showing his change from the start of the
					novel. On Griz's path to his revenge, he had started to change, esspecially on what he would do in
					certain situations. Griz's morals were completly changed for the worse when he lied to others due to
					him pursuing his revenge. Earlier in the novel, Griz had met John Dark in the middle of the
					forest. John Dark was on her own path for revenge where she was trying to find the person who had
					killed her daughters.When John Dark had found Griz and saved him from a bull, Griz stated, "I did
					understand what
					the gun meant when it lowered and pointed at me"(Fletcher 182). John Dark had a lot of principles,
					for
					example, her being kind to others and being sympathetic towards others. When John Dark met Griz,
					they were in a very vulnerable position where they were trapped and had recently lost the dog they
					had spent the last few days. Since she “lowered” the gun and "pointed" it at Griz, she showed her
					dedication to controlling Griz by threatening him even though her own family was also harmed by
					someone else she was currently trying to find. John Dark took advantage of Griz when he was trapped
					and had just lost his dog by controlling him with the gun that she had. By controlling Griz with the
					gun that she had and taking advantage of Griz's helpless position, John Dark spoiled her morality of
					being kind and respectful to others by controlling Griz due to her personal hunt for revenge.
