			<p>
				This quote about fear resontates with me and seems very relevant right now as many people are scared of
				things and also don't like the idea of being scared. This quote and the context around it explain that
				it could be very helpful to help yourself and others and keep them safe.</p>
			<p>
				I chose the book <i>A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World</i> because it seemed to have a good
				concept. The perceived concept of the book that I chose was the idea that the book was based on a young
				kid that was seeking revenge for his dog. While, this book did follow the idea of revenge, it also
				mentioned alot of other themes such as one trusting others.
